# About

Overview:
Snacki is a mobile app that delivers your favorite stadium food right to your seat, so you don't miss any of the action. It features on demand food, an account system to save your food history, and user-configurable features like teams, foods, and more.

Why?
Mobile is now the most used platform.

# Operations

Snacki will have a similar business strategy to that of DoorDash. People can log on to the app or website and have their food delivered to them for a small fee. DoorDash has a fee of about $5-$10 dollars to deliver it. I would think that we could deliver it for a $0.5 to $3 fee.

How it would work:

1. Hungry fan will log on to app
   a. Download from app store
   b. Scan barcode URL from arm rest
2. Choose their favorite concession
3. Check out
   a. Put in phone number, email, seat number
4. Runner will receive notification of food
5. Runner will then be able to go straight to the front of the concession and grab the order
   a. Will verify by showing them the phone, with pink background of name and order number
6. Runner will head to the seat
7. Hungry fan will show them their phone, with order number and name
8. Repeat

Pricing:

- Same initial price as at the concession stand
- Customer will pay for it + tax + runner fee
- Runner fee will be low
- Can strike a deal with the arena for discounted prices
  a. 50% of hotdogs if Nuggets score over 70 points by halftime

Runner Information:

- Bright pink polo shirt
- Khaki or black pants
- Will have the Snacki Runner app with order information
- Wear mask and shield like waiters do in Mexico City
- Will have a tray or bag to deliver the food
- Show the runner app to the concessions to verify orders

Obstacles to climb:

1. Get permission from the arena and the concessions stands.
2. How to pay the runners?
3. What happens if there is no wifi or cellular data?

Road Map:
CU Arena -> Ball Arena -> All arenas in CO -> All in the US -> All in the world
